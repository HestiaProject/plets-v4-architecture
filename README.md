# plets-v4-architecture
Repository with architectural information of PLeTs v4 that is relevant to the Hestia Project

Installing Latex:

Run latexinstall.sh on Ubuntu-based Linux and it will install all necessary packages.

Using the basic.bib:

DO NOT REMOVE ENTRIES FROM THIS FILE.

Compiling:

Run "make" inside the architecture manual directory and it will build the pdf based on the current files.

ALTERNATIVELY:

Upload the necessary files wherever you prefer (sharelatex, overleaf, etc), alter as needed and forward the ALTERED FILES ONLY to me, so that I may merge them.
