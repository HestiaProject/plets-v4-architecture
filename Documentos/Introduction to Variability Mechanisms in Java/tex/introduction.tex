\chapter*{Introduction}

In order to properly implement the design decisions made for the PLeTs v4 project, it is necessary that the programmers involved be aware of certain mechanisms, both theoretical and practical, that will be used in its development. This document will serve both as a basis for the study and explanation of these techniques and as a guide for the appropriate implementation of them in PLeTs v4.

Chapter \ref{ch:staticfinal} will present the notion of using compilation directives for conditional compilation. First a basic theory of the concept is presented. Afterwards, the specific mechanism of using Static Final variables in Java is presented, along with its advantages and limitations.
